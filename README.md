# React challenge

Practice using React to create dynamic apps in the browser.

## Setup

Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/react-challenge/generate), clone your copy, `cd` into it
1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
1. Run `npm run dev` to start the local dev server

## Checking your work

Each challenge has associated unit tests. You can run each challenge's tests with `./test/run 1`, `./test/run 2` etc.

Make sure you read test failures carefullyâ€”the output can be noisy but the error message should provide useful information to help you.

You can import and render the component you're working on inside `challenge/App.jsx` to see it appear on the page.

## Challenge 1: creating components

Create a new file `challenge/Greeting.jsx` that default-exports a component called `Greeting`. The component should take a prop called `name` and use it to render a `<p>` element that greets the user. E.g. `<Greeting name="oli">` should render `<p>Hello oli</p`>.

## Challenge 2: using state

Create a new file `challenge/Shouter.jsx` that default-exports a component called `Shouter`. The component should render an `<input>` element and an `<output>` element. As the user types the text should appear in the output, but transformed into uppercase. E.g. after the user types "hello world" the output should be `<output>HELLO WORLD</output>`.

## Challenge 3: mouse tracking

Create a new file `challenge/MouseTracker.jsx` that default-exports a component called `MouseTracker`. The component should render an `<output>` element. It should attach a "mousemove" event listener to the window and keep track of the `clientX` and `clientY` values (i.e. the coordinates of the mouse as it moves). Display the coordinates separated by a comma in the `<output>`.

E.g. if I move my mouse to the top left of the window the component should render: `<output>0,0</output>`. If I move my mouse 125 pixels across and 20 pixels down it should render: `<output>125,20</output>`.
